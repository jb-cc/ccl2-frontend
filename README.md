# SKINFINITY CS:GO SkinMarketplace - Frontend (CCL2)

Skinfinity is a CS:GO Skin marketplace that allows users to buy and sell (not real) CS:GO Skins. It is a project for the final project (Creative Code Lab) of the second semester of the Bachelor's degree program "Creative Computing" at the St. PÃ¶lten University of Applied Sciences.


## Installation

Clone the repositories:

[Backend](https://github.com/jb-cc/ccl2-backend)

[Frontend](https://github.com/jb-cc/ccl2-frontend)

There are three parts to this Project, the Frontend, the Backend, and the database. You need all of them to run this app.
You need Node.js on your system to run this web application. You also need a MySQL database, as well as an IDE that can edit JavaScript.



To install the dependencies, open the root folder of both Backend and Frontend in your IDE, and run

```bash
npm install
```
in your terminal.

(BACKEND):
Then, create a .env file in the root of the CCL SERVER directory. This file will contain the required configurations for the API. You can use a text editor to create and edit this file. Example .env file:

```javascript
DB_USERNAME=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=secret

```

replace the values with your database credentials, and create a new secret

You can find the sql file for the database here: [SQL File](https://github.com/jb-cc/ccl2-database/blob/main/ccl2-database.sql)

In the version you clone from git (or download from the ecampus), the ports and urls are set to http://localhost:8081/ (this is where the frontend is running) and http://localhost:8080/ (for the backend).
If you want to change this, run a replace all in your frontend, and replace http://localhost:8080/ with the desired backend url. In the Backend, you have to navigate to the server.js file, and change the origin to your new frontend adress

```
let corsOptions = {
    // origin: 'https://cc221012-10141.node.fhstp.io',
    origin: 'http://localhost:8081',
    credentials: true,
};
```
also, change your port to your new port the backend runs at: (also server.js)
```
// The port the server will listen on
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;

```
just to be sure, run
```
npm install
```
again.


These are the dependencies for the backend:

```
"dependencies": {
"bcrypt": "^5.1.0",
"body-parser": "^1.20.2",
"cookie-parser": "^1.4.6",
"cors": "^2.8.5",
"dotenv": "^16.1.4",
"express": "^4.18.2",
"express-jwt": "^8.4.1",
"jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.0",
"mysql": "^2.18.1"
}
```

These are the dependencies for the frontend:

```
"dependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.14",
    "axios": "^1.4.0",
    "pinia": "^2.1.4",
    "postcss": "^8.4.24",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.2",
    "vue": "^3.3.4",
    "vue-router": "^4.2.2"
 }
```


Then, to start the backend, run 
```
node server.js
```
and the frontend (in the CCL2 Frontend directory) with
```
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Go to http://localhost:8081/ in your browser, or to the route you customized.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure all dependencies are properly installed.
Double-check the configuration of environment variables in the .env file.
Ensure your database connection details are accurate.
Check the console for any error messages.
